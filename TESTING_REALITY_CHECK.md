# Testing Reality Check

**Status:** 🔍 INVESTIGATING ACTUAL TEST RESULTS

---

## Current Test Results

**Total Tests:** 650+ tests  
**Failed:** 494 tests  
**Warnings:** 683 warnings  
**Assertions:** 1,644 assertions  

---

## Key Question: What Does "Failed" Mean?

The "failed" tests are likely:
1. **Incomplete implementations** - Basic test stubs that need real test code
2. **Missing factories** - Models without factories
3. **Missing dependencies** - Tests that need setup
4. **Real failures** - Actual bugs in code

---

## Investigation Needed

1. Check what's actually failing
2. Identify root causes
3. Determine if failures are:
   - Expected (incomplete implementations)
   - Fixable (missing setup)
   - Real bugs (need code fixes)

---

## Next Steps

1. Analyze failure patterns
2. Fix common issues
3. Complete test implementations
4. Achieve actual passing tests
